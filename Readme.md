# Mineclone

A small clone of Minecraft, as it's name says,
Inspired by the numerous clones of Minecraft


## Build 
Requires `conan` (for prerequisites) and `clang` (which support as much as possible c++20, I compile using clang 13). 

`GCC 11` fails miserably to compile this program. Maybe GCC will 13 work. I did not try.

```
>>> mkdir build && cd Build
>>> cmake ..
>>> make 
```
